	<body>
		<p>The <link href="&hivedoc;/service/hivemind.lib.ServicePropertyFactory.html">
			ServicePropertyFactory</link> exposes a property of a service as a new service.
      The property's type must the same as (or assignable to) the service interface.
      </p>
      
      <p>On each invocation of a service method, the property is re-acquired from
        the property source service, and the method reinvoked on the active value.
      This is useful when the value of the property can change at different times ...
      by using this factory,
      and not the <code>service-property</code>  <link href="site:hivemind.ObjectProviders">object provider</link>,
      your code will always access the current value.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This can invaluable when a small number of services use the threaded or pooled service models.
        Other services can access information in those services transparently, without themselves having
        to be threaded or pooled.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A single parameter element is expected:
      </p>
      
      <source>
<![CDATA[<construct service-id="..." property="..."/>]]>      
      </source>
      
      <p>
        Both attributes are required. 
      </p>
